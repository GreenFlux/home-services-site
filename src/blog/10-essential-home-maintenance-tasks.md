Regular home maintenance is the key to preventing small problems from becoming expensive repairs. As professional home repair specialists, we've seen countless issues that could have been avoided with proper preventive care. Here are the 10 most important maintenance tasks every homeowner should prioritize.

## 1. Clean and Inspect Gutters Seasonally

Clogged gutters can cause water damage to your roof, siding, and foundation. Clean them at least twice a year and inspect for:
- Loose or missing hardware
- Cracks or holes
- Proper drainage away from the foundation

## 2. Change HVAC Filters Monthly

A dirty filter makes your system work harder and reduces air quality. Replace filters monthly during peak usage seasons and every 2-3 months during mild weather.

## 3. Test Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors

Test all detectors monthly and replace batteries twice a year. Replace the entire unit every 10 years for smoke detectors and every 5-7 years for carbon monoxide detectors.

## 4. Inspect and Clean Dryer Vents

Lint buildup in dryer vents is a fire hazard and reduces efficiency. Clean the lint trap after every load and have the entire vent system professionally cleaned annually.

## 5. Check for Water Leaks

Inspect under sinks, around toilets, and near water heaters monthly. Look for:
- Water stains or discoloration
- Musty odors
- Soft or warped flooring
- Increased water bills

## 6. Maintain Weather Stripping and Caulking

Check windows and doors for gaps that let air escape. Replace worn weather stripping and re-caulk areas where you see cracks or gaps.

## 7. Service Your Water Heater Annually

Flush your water heater annually to remove sediment buildup. Check the temperature setting (120Â°F is recommended) and inspect for signs of corrosion or leaks.

## 8. Trim Trees and Shrubs

Keep vegetation at least 3 feet away from your home's exterior. Trim branches that overhang your roof to prevent damage during storms.

## 9. Inspect Your Roof

Look for missing, damaged, or curling shingles. Check flashing around chimneys and vents. Address small issues before they become major problems.

## 10. Deep Clean and Inspect Appliances

Regular cleaning extends appliance life and improves efficiency:
- Clean refrigerator coils
- Descale the dishwasher
- Clean washing machine drums
- Inspect appliance cords and connections

## When to Call Professionals

While these tasks help prevent problems, some issues require professional attention:
- Electrical problems
- Major plumbing leaks
- HVAC system repairs
- Structural concerns
- Roof repairs

## Creating a Maintenance Schedule

Organize these tasks by frequency:
- **Monthly**: HVAC filters, detector tests, leak checks
- **Seasonally**: Gutters, weather stripping, appliance deep cleaning
- **Annually**: Water heater service, roof inspection, dryer vent cleaning
- **As needed**: Tree trimming, caulking repairs

Regular maintenance might seem like work, but it's far less expensive and stressful than dealing with emergency repairs. If you're unsure about any maintenance task or discover problems during your inspections, don't hesitate to contact professional repair services for guidance.
